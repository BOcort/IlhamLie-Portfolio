    "shortDescription": "Hybrid ensemble framework for short-term weather forecasting using visual cloud imagery and numerical meteorological data.",
    "description": "This study successfully developed a hybrid ensemble framework for short-term weather forecasting in Manokwari by integrating visual cloud imagery and numerical meteorological data. The implementation of a time-based adaptive weighting mechanism (Alpha-Blending) effectively resolved the performance degradation typically caused by diurnal lighting variations.",
    "fullDescription": "Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed conditional ensemble achieves superior predictive performance, with an overall accuracy of 92.49% and a macro F1-score of 0.91. This approach significantly outperforms standalone models by maintaining predictive continuity during nighttime periods and resolving visual ambiguities between 'Cloudy' and 'Clear' states that often plague vision-only systems. These findings support previous theories regarding the necessity of multimodal data fusion to navigate atmospheric volatility in maritime regions. Ultimately, this research advances computational meteorology by providing a practical, high-accuracy early warning solution that is responsive to diurnal cycle variations.",
